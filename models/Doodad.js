// Doodads are extra things: Either a Treasure, a Trap, or a Secret. The models are interchangeable, so we're just going to make one model rather than three. We can then give the user a drop-down menu to select what type it will be.

// id
// name
// type:
    // Trease, trap, secret
// is_active
// room
// Text string entered by user.
